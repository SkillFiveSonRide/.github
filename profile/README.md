=========================================================================

CHAPTER I: GENERAL PROVISIONS

Article 1: Nature of the Organization
The International Skill Gobang Strategic Development Union (hereinafter referred to as "the Union") is a non-profit, non-rational, and highly abstract strategic entity. It is voluntarily formed by global enthusiasts who reject traditional logic and advocate for a synthesis of physical confrontation and psychological warfare within the domain of board games.

Article 2: Fundamental Principles
The Union is dedicated to the subversion of the archaic dogma known as "Five-in-a-Row." We uphold the competitive spirit of "Conquest through Skills, Persuasion through Physics."
The Union Motto: "The chessboard is not the boundary; the Skill is the limit. Logic is optional; Audacity is mandatory."

Article 3: Vision and Mission
1. Vision: To construct a multiverse where "Everything is Gobang," establishing table-flipping as a universally recognized diplomatic gesture.
2. Mission:
    - To promulgate the philosophy of "Preemptive Strike (Skill) before Cognitive Processing."
    - To standardize tactical maneuvers including, but not limited to, "Table Overturning," "Retroactive Move Retraction," and "Void Placement."
    - To foster deep philosophical exchange regarding the concept: "I may have lost the match, but I have won at life."

CHAPTER II: ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS

Article 4: Governing Body
The supreme authority of the Union is the Grand Ultimate Skill Committee. The Chairperson shall be an individual capable of executing the "Strength to Uproot Mountains" (Board Destruction) maneuver three consecutive times without sustaining a lumbar injury.

Article 5: Functional Departments
1. Department of Physical Intervention: Responsible for safety inspections of all somatic skills (e.g., board smashing, piece snatching) to ensure the integrity of the players, if not the equipment.
2. Bureau of Acoustic Impact: Tasked with assessing the decibel levels and "Cringe Factor" of skill incantations.
3. Office of Logic Demolition: Exclusively handles complaints regarding traditional rules (e.g., "Why did I lose with six pieces?"). The standard official response shall be: "Because the opponent activated Temporal Regression."

Article 8: Obligations of Members
